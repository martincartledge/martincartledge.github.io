This is the second post in my series _Data Structures and Algorithims using JavaScript_. Last week, I discussed [_Time Complexity, Space Complexity, and Big O Notation_](https://www.martincartledge.io/time-complexity-Space-complexity-and-big-o-notation/). This week I am going to talk about a very popular data structure that most programmers use on a daily basis, the _Array_. In this post, I will cover the Big O of common array actions (`push`, `delete`, etc) and we will also walk through the process of creating our very own _Array_ data structure! Let's get started.

## What is an Array?

> A collection of multiple values that can be stored using a single variable

- The length can not be fixed
- The types of values can not be fixed
- Can not use strings as an index to an element, must use an integer

> Note: using bracket notation (`[]`) will not set or retrieve an element from the array, instead it will set or retrieve a variable that is associated with that array's object property collection. You can read more about that [right here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Properties)

## Common Array actions

### Lookup

### Push

### Insert
