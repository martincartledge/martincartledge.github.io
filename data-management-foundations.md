SQL structured query language
> formulate questions a database can respond to

Data

> numeric, textual, visual, or audio information that describes real-world systems

- Scope: amount of data produced and collected can vary
- Format: can be produced as numbers, text, images, audio, or video
- Access: private and public

Database

> collection of data in a structured format

Database system

> (database management system, DBMS) software that reads and writes data in a database

Query

> a request to retrieve or change data in a database

Query language

> A specialize programming language designed specifically for database systems

Used as data manpulation language, DML
- CRUD

Used as a data definition language, DDL
- Edit structure (schema)

SQL statements:
- Whitespace independent
- Composed of clauses
- Keywords tell database to take action

`LIKE`
- Match a charcter within a field
- The beginning, middle, or end
- Use the `%` operator, i.e. `LIKE 'M%'`, `LIKE '%A%'`, `LIKE '%N'`

Use `LENGTH` to return number of characters within a given field i.e. (`SELECT LENGTH(first_name) FROM people;`)

Return unique values by using `DISTINCT` keyword i.e. (`SELECT DISTINCT(first_name) FROM people;`)

Use `COUNT` to return number of matching records within a specified criteria i.e. (`SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM people WHERE first_name='Martin';`)

```sql
SELECT name, team, score, prize
FROM people
ORDER BY prize, team;
```

`JOIN` (inner join)

> Ask for records across two tables that are associated with each other based on a common piece of information

```sql
SELECT people.first_name, people.state_code, states.division
FROM people
JOIN states ON people.state_code=states.state_abbrev;
```

`Implicit (inner) JOIN`

```sql
SELECT people.first_name, states.state_name
FROM people, states
WHERE people.state_code, states.state_abbrev
```

`LEFT JOIN`

```sql
SELECT people.first_name, state.state_name
FROM states
LEFT JOIN people ON people.state_code=states.state_abbrev;
```

`GROUP BY`

> Run query for each field name that is specified i.e. `SELECT state_code, COUNT(state_code) FROM people GROUP BY state_code;`

```sql
SELECT states.state_name, COUNT(people.shirt_or_hat)
FROM states
JOIN people ON states.state_abbrev=people.state_code
WHERE people.shirt_or_hat='hat
GROUP BY people.shirt_or_hat, states.state_name;
```

```sql
SELECT states.division, people.team, COUNT(people.team)
FROM states
JOIN people ON states.state_abbrev=people.state_code
GROUP BY states.division, people.team;
```

#### Primary keys

> a field in a table that uniquely identifies the table records

- Must contain a unique value for each row
- It cannot contain `null` values

`SHOW`

> displays info contained in the database and its tables

`SHOW TABLES`

> command used to display all tables within the current MySQL database

`SHOW COLUMNS`

> displays information about the columns within a table

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM tableName
```

#### Transactions

> group of queries that must be completed or rejected as a whole

- ensure all transactions are processed completely or not at all
- prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions
- ensure transaction results are never lost

#### Architecture

> describes the internal components and the relationships between components

Query processor

> interprets queries, creates a plan to modify the database or retrieve datam and returns query results to the application

Storage manager

> translates the query processor instructions into low-level file system commands that modify or retrieve data

Transaction manager

> ensures transactions are properly executed

Log

> a file containing a complete record of all inserts, updates, and deletes processed by the database

Catalog (data dictionary)

> directory of tables, columns, indexes, and other database objects

#### Column data types

`INT` stores integer values

`DECIMAL` store fractional numeric values

`VARCHAR` stores textual values

`DATE` stores year, month, and day

#### Database design

> specification of database objects, tables, columns, data types, and indexes

Entity

> a person, place, activity, or thing

Relationship

> a link between entities

Attribute

> a descriptive property of an entity

Entities, relationships, and attributes are depicted in *ER diagrams*

- Rectangles represent entities, entity names appear at the top of the rectanges
- Lines between rectangles represent relationships
- Text inside rectangles and below entity names represent attributes

Three phases:
- Analysis, specifies database requirements without regard to a database system
- Logical design, 
- Physical design

#### Logical design

> phase that implements database requirements in a specific database system

Key 

> a colum used to identify individual rows of a table

Logical design is depicted in a *table diagram*

- Rectangles represent tables, table names appear at the top of rectangles
- Text within rectangles and below table names represent columns
- Solid bullets â€¢ indicate key columns
- Empty bullets and arrows -> <- indicate columns that refer to *keys*

Schema

> the logical design, specified in SQL and depicted in a table diagram

#### Physical design

> Phase that adds indexes and specifies how tables are organized on storage media

Data independence

> the principle that physical design never affects query results

- allows designers to tune query performance without changes to the application program
- when designers modify indexes or row order, applications run slower or faster

### API, Application Programming Interface

> library of procedures or classes that link a hosts programming language to a database

### Relational model

> a database model based on the following mathematical principles:

- data structure that prescibes how data is ogranized
- operations that manipulate data structures
- rules that govern valid relational data

Relational data structures and operations are based on *set theory*

Set

> collection of values or elements with no inherent order

The relational data structure is based on three mathematical concepts:

- domain: named set of possible database values
- tuple: a finite sequence of values, drawn from a fixed domain `integers, dictionarywords logicalvalues`
- relation: named set of tuples, drawn from the same sequence of domains

Relational terms

| Mathematical | Database  | Files     |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Domain       | Data type | Data type |
| Tuple        | Rpw       | Record    |
| Relation     | Table     | File      |
| Attribute    | Column    | Field     |

Datbase model

> a conceptual framework for database software

### Relational operations

- select: selects a subset of rows of a table
- project: eliminates one or more columns of a table
- product: lists all possible combinations of rows or tables
- join: a product operation followed by a select operation
- union: combines two tables by selecting all rows of both tables
- intersect: combines two tables by selecting only rows common to both tables
- difference: combines two tables by selecting rows that appear in one table but not the other

The result of relational operations is always a table

### Relational rules (integrity rules)

> logical constraints that ensure data is valid and conforms to business policy

##### structural rules

> relational rules that govern data in every relational database

- unique primary key: all tables should have a column with no repeated values
- unique column names: different columns of the same table must have different names
- no duplicate rows: no two rows of the same table may have identical values in all columns

##### business rules

> relational rules specific to a particular database and application

- unique column names: in a particular column, values may not be repeated
- no missing values: in a particular column, all rows must have known values
- delete cascade: when a row is deleted, automatically delete all related row


### Data types

- integer: positive and negative integers, `INT` (4 bytes), `SMALLINT` (2 bytes)
- decimal: numbers with fractional values, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`
- character: textual characters, `CHAR` (fixed string of characters), `VARCHAR` (string of variable length up to a specified max size)
- time: represent time, date, or both, `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`
- binary: stores data as it appears in memory or computer files, `BLOB`, `BINARY`, `VARBINARY`, `IMAGE`
- spatial: store geometic information, lines, polygons, map coordinates, `POLYGON`, `POINT`, `GEOMETRY`
- document: textual data in a structured format i.e. XML or JSON

### Null values

> Null is a special value that represents missing data

Modify the SELECT statement to only select songs that have a NULL Title value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Song (
  ID INT,
  Title VARCHAR(60),
  Artist VARCHAR(60),
  ReleaseYear INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

INSERT INTO Song VALUES
  (100, 'Hey Jude', 'Beatles', 1968),
  (200, NULL, 'Taylor Swift', 2008),
  (300, 'Need You Now', NULL, 2011),
  (400, 'That\'s The Way Love Goes', NULL, 1993),
  (500, NULL, 'Nirvana', 1991);

SELECT *
FROM Song
WHERE Title IS NULL;
```

### Primary Keys

> A column or group of columns used to identify a row

#### Composite primary keys

> primary key that consists of multiple columns

- Denoted with parentheses
- When grouped together, column values must be unique
- Columns cannot contain `null`
- Composite primary keys must be minimal

#### Minimal primary key

> All columns are necessary for uniqueness

- When any column is removed from a minimal composite primary key, the resulting simple or composite column is no longer unique

### Foreign keys

> a column or group of columns that refer to a primary key

- Values can be repeated
- Values can be `null`
- Non-null foreign key values must match unique primary key value

#### Referential integrity

> requires that all foreign keys must be `null` or match a primary key value

- In relation databases, foreign keys must obey referential integrity at all times

Can be violated in four ways:

- A primary key is updated
- A foreign key is updated
- A row containing a primary key is deleted
- A row containing a foreign key is inserted

Databases can automatically correct referential integrity violations with any of the following four actions:

- `RESTRICT` rejects an insert, update, delete that violates referential integrity
- `SET NULL` set invalid foreign keys to `null`
- `SET DEFAULT` sets invalid foreign keys to a default primary value
- `CASCADE` propagates primary key changes to foreign keys

`RESTRICT` is applied when no action is specified

`SET NULL` cannot be used when a foreign key is not allowed

The value specified for `SET DEFAULT` must be a valid primary key

### Inner and outer joins

> a `SELECT` statement that combines data from two tables, the left and the right table, into a single result

Tables are combined by comparing columns from the left and right tables with the `=` operator

The columns data types have to be comparable

Typically, a join compares a foreign key of one table to the primary key of another, this is not required though

In cases that columns names are the same, a prefix of the table name should be used

```sql
SELECT Council.Name, Jedi.Name
FROM Council, Jedi
WHERE Council.ID = Jedi.ID;
```

#### Left and right joins

##### Left join

> Selects all left table rows, but only matching right table rows

##### Right join

> Selects all right table rows, but only matching left table rows

##### Outer join

> Any join that selects unmatched rows, including left, right , and full joins
