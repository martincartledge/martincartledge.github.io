This is the second post in my series _Interview Insights_. In my last post, I shared my thoughts on how to get an interview as a software developer. This week, I will share my thoughts on how you should prepare for an interview. Tech interview are notoriously nerve-racking and unpredictable; however, there are steps you can take to mitigate a lot of these feelings.

## Phases of the interview process

> the modern foundation of software interviews

- Phone screen
- Technical phone interview
- On site

### Phone screen

> the "tell me about yourself" conversation

After you apply and a company has interest in you, the first step is usually to schedule a _phone interview_. This is usually a pretty relaxed conversation with a member of HR. You can expect them to ask primarily about your job history, what you are looking for next, and most importantly, why you are applying for a position at their company.

Just because this is typically _easier_ than the other phases of the interview process does not mean you should not prepare for it. A few questions to prepare for are:

##### Tell me a little bit about yourself

This is a good time to give your "elevator pitch". A few things you want to mention:

- Ethos or interests you share with the company
- What excites _you_ about software development

##### What is a recent project you worked on that you are proud of?

- Give a quick overview of what the project is and the problem is solves
- Mention the technologies you used in this project

##### Why are you looking to leave your current company?

- Turn any potentially negative factor into a positive one
  - i.e. "I am bored and unsatisfied with the work I do here" -> "I am looking for a new challenge that stretches my programming muscles"
-

### Technical phone screen

> the "show me what you got" conversation

### On site

- Virtual pair programming
- Take home assignments (timed and not timed)
- White boarding

## Soft skills

> hypothetical, situational, past experience

Although parts of the interview process can be hard to predict, you can count on a sizable portion to cover soft skills.

Interviews for software developer's can be tricky for several reasons, but at their core I think it is because there

## Picking a language

> embrace what you are comfortable with, stick to what you know

It is fairly common to want to use (or learn) multiple languages in our field; however, when preparing for an interview, it is best to stick with just one. This will help shift your focus from worrying about which language you will use, to thinking of problems you have solved with the language you are most comfortable with.

Once you decide on a language, think of the mechanics the language offers that you could be better with. A good way to determine what to focus on is to think of a feature of the language that would serve you well in an interview.

i.e. You are a JavaScript developer, and you are not at strong with ES6 syntax and features as you would like to be.

## Preparation tools

Interviews in the tech industry are far from uniform, but I like to think of that as a positive. This keeps things interesting and can allow you to show off your skills in a new way.

When it comes to preparing for an interview, there are two categories of preparation to keep in mind:

#### Company specific topics / questions

#### General topics / questions

Depending on the size and type of company you are interviewing at, the way they interview might differ. I suggest you use websites such as Blind or Glassdoor to gain insight to company-specific interview topics and questions.
