This is the second post in my series _Interview Insights_. In my last post, I shared my thoughts on how to get an interview as a software developer. This week, I will share my thoughts on how you should prepare for an interview. Tech interview are notoriously nerve-racking and unpredictable; however, there are steps you can take to mitigate a lot of these feelings.

## Phases of the interview process

> the modern foundation of software interviews

- Phone screen
- Technical phone interview
- On site

### Phone screen

> the "tell me about yourself" conversation

After you apply and a company has interest in you, the first step is usually to schedule a _phone interview_. This is usually a pretty relaxed conversation with a member of HR. You can expect them to ask primarily about your job history, what you are looking for next, and most importantly, why you are applying for a position at their company.

Just because this is typically _easier_ than the other phases of the interview process does not mean you should not prepare for it. A few questions to prepare for are:

##### Tell me a little bit about yourself

This is a good time to give your "elevator pitch". A few things you want to mention:

- Ethos or interests you share with the company
- What excites _you_ about software development

##### What is a recent project you worked on that you are proud of?

- Give a quick overview of what the project is and the problem is solves
- Mention the technologies you used in this project

##### Why are you looking to leave your current company?

- Turn any potentially negative factor into a positive one
  - i.e. "I am bored and unsatisfied with the work I do here" -> "I am looking for a new challenge that stretches my programming muscles"
-

### Technical phone screen

> the "show me what you got" conversation

Generally, this step is a conversation with a senior member of the team you would join, or the manager of that team. You can expect a lot of this conversation to be catered towards two things:

- Recent problems you have experienced in your current position and the solutions you implemented for them
- General language familiarity (i.e. when would you want to use an array instead of a hash map (object)?)

To help prepare for this interview, I suggest you start to write down answers to these questions. Personally, I have used an excel or google sheet document that consists of 3 columns: _questions_, _answers_, and _notes_. You will find that taking the action of writing your answers down will help you come up with a concise and impactful answer.

There are a lot of resources online that list common interview questions, for [frontend](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions), [backend](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions), or [fullstack](https://github.com/aershov24/full-stack-interview-questions) roles.

This might seem like a lot of work upfront but trust me, by spending the time to prepare and convert your thoughts to pen and paper will really help you mentally flush out your answers.

### On site

> the final boss

The final stage of the interview process is usually what is commonly referred to as the _on-site_. This is usually the most in-depth and the most important to perform well at.

Depending on the company this interview can include various elements, but a few that are most common are:

- Virtual pair programming
- Take home assignments (timed and not timed)
- White boarding

One of the main questions the company would like to have a good answer for is, _how does this person work?_ The answer to this question is usually echoed through multiple levels as well, i.e. personal, technical, and professional.

Companies seek for this answer by giving the candidate various exercises, technical and interpersonal, to gauge your skills and how well you will fit in at their company.

One of the most common methods of gauging your skills is to pair program with a member of the team you might work with. This session is usually 20 to 30 minutes and the problem you are given is generally something you will see on the job at this company. There are a few things to keep in mind if you have a session like this:

- Try to stay calm and remember that _you are interviewing here for a reason_, they like you and see promise in you
- Communicate out loud as much as possible, even if you think you are talking too much, it's better to over communicate in these exercises than to sit in silence typing away with the keyboard
-

## Soft skills

> hypothetical, situational, past experience

Although parts of the interview process can be hard to predict, you can count on a sizable portion to cover soft skills.

Interviews for software developer's can be tricky for several reasons, but at their core I think it is because there

## Picking a language

> embrace what you are comfortable with, stick to what you know

It is fairly common to want to use (or learn) multiple languages in our field; however, when preparing for an interview, it is best to stick with just one. This will help shift your focus from worrying about which language you will use, to thinking of problems you have solved with the language you are most comfortable with.

Once you decide on a language, think of the mechanics the language offers that you could be better with. A good way to determine what to focus on is to think of a feature of the language that would serve you well in an interview.

i.e. You are a JavaScript developer, and you are not at strong with ES6 syntax and features as you would like to be.

## Preparation tools

Interviews in the tech industry are far from uniform, but I like to think of that as a positive. This keeps things interesting and can allow you to show off your skills in a new way.

When it comes to preparing for an interview, there are two categories of preparation to keep in mind:

#### Company specific topics / questions

Depending on the size and type of company you are interviewing at, the way they interview might differ. I suggest you use websites such as [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/) or [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) to gain insight to company-specific interview topics and questions.

#### General topics / questions

You can expect these questions to touch on your work style, recent achievements, and your technical competency. A few topics that you can expect to be asked about are:

- Tell me about a time that you had to deal with a tricky bug. How did you fix it? What was the outcome?
- Do you prefer to work by collaborating (pairing) with others or on your own?

## Mock interviews

> practice without the pressure

Have you ever practiced a big presentation for school in front of friends or family? You might have still been nervous but, it sure does help you feel more comfortable speaking about your topic.

Interviewing is also a presentation, and the concept of practice runs are just as important. In the 2020 world, most interviews are completed remotely, which makes performing mock interviews feel more _real_.

If you know someone who is currently in the software industry, I would ask them if they would be willing to set aside an hour or so a week to perform these mock interviews with you. If they currently work in a similar role that you are interviewing for, even better!

A few other options are [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) and [CodeInterview](https://codeinterview.io/). These sites allow you to schedule an interview, pick a primary focus (topic), language, and area of expertise (frontend, backend, etc). These platforms also give you more flexibility so you do not have to worry about scheduling time with someone you personally know.

Interviews are nerve racking; however, I am confident as you complete more, your confidence and comfort level will increase.
