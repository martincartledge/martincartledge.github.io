This is the second post in my series _Interview Insights_. In my last post, I shared my thoughts on how to get an interview as a software developer. This week, I will share my thoughts on how you should prepare for an interview. Tech interview are notoriously nerve-racking and unpredictable; however, there are steps you can take to mitigate a lot of these feelings.

## Phases of the interview process

> the modern foundation of software interviews

- Phone screen
- Technical phone interview
- On site

### Phone screen

> the "tell me about yourself" conversation

After you apply and a company has interest in you, the first step is usually to schedule a _phone interview_. This is usually a pretty relaxed conversation with a member of HR. You can expect them to ask primarily about your job history, what you are looking for next, and most importantly, why you are applying for a position at their company.

Just because this is typically _easier_ than the other phases of the interview process does not mean you should not prepare for it. A few questions to prepare for are:

##### Tell me a little bit about yourself

This is a good time to give your "elevator pitch". A few things you want to mention:

- Ethos or interests you share with the company
- What excites _you_ about software development

##### What is a recent project you worked on that you are proud of?

- Give a quick overview of what the project is and the problem is solves
- Mention the technologies you used in this project

##### Why are you looking to leave your current company?

- Turn any potentially negative factor into a positive one
  - i.e. "I am bored and unsatisfied with the work I do here" -> "I am looking for a new challenge that stretches my programming muscles"

### Technical phone screen

> the "show me what you got" conversation

### On site

- Virtual pair programming
- Take home assignments (timed and not timed)
- White boarding

## Soft skills

> hypothetical, situational, past experience

Although parts of the interview process can be hard to predict, you can count on a sizable portion to cover soft skills.

Interviews for software developer's can be tricky for several reasons, but at their core I think it is because there

## Picking a language

> embrace what you are comfortable with, stick to what you know

## Preparation tools

> by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail

## Mock interviews

> practice without the pressure
