#### How are data structures used?

Data structures handle four main functions for us:

- Inputting information
- Processing information
- Maintaining information
- Retrieving information

> Data structures that use static memory allocation (e.g., stacks or arrays) will manage memory for you and assume a fixed amount of memory upon instantiation with a cap on how much data may be added.

> Data structures that utilize dynamic memory allocation (e.g., heaps or linked lists) allow you to allocate and reallocate memory within the life of the program

##### data structure apis

> An API allows end-users to access properties and methods of data structures easily and without needing to do the “behind the scenes” work.

> Some languages have classes that can have methods or fields that are either public (can be called from anywhere) or private (can only be called from within the class).

> As you build your own classes and data structures, it’s important to keep in mind this distinction between implementation (what does this need internally to do its job) and the outside API (how should users of this actually interact with it?).
