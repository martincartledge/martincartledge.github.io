This is the first post in my series _Interview Insights_. This week, I will share my thoughts and steps an individual should take to increase their chances of getting an interview as a software developer. Whether you are starting out, or looking for something new, I am confident that you will find value in what I share below. Let's get started!

## Determine your ideal role

This might sound strange, but I think it is a question that is overlooked.

Due to the eclectic nature of our industry, it is common to just apply to _any_ kind of job. This is tricky because, on one hand, you want interviews and experience with different technologies; however, I have found that answering the questions can put you ahead in your search:

> _What kind of developer do I want to be?_

If you are looking for your first job, this might be the hardest question you have to answer. Although this might seem overly simplified, I do think it is most important to pick a niche of software that makes _you happy_. After all, you are the one that will be doing this work 40 hours a week, right?

If you are brand new to software development and are not sure what you like best, I suggest browsing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and take a course that sounds interesting to you!

It is easy to get caught in a state of limbo when you are not sure what to do next. My advice is when that happens is to just pick something and try it.

> _What kind of company do I want to work for?_

This might be another tricky question to answer; however, it can really save you lots of headaches down the road. In software development, there are typically three _types_ of companies:

### Startups

> Typically under 500 employees, less than 5 years old, fast-paced environment

Pros:

- You will play a large role in the problems that your company is trying to solve
- Working with cutting edge technology in the industry
- Lots of opportunity to learn from senior developers

Cons:

- Responsible for ("own") more pieces of the codebase
- Processes such as code review and a team code style might not be established
- Quickly throwing out code you contributed to due to trying other ideas

### Mid-sized companies

> Typically 500-5,000 employees, 5+ years old

Pros:

- High chance of the company being profitable (job security)
- More onboarding resources and documentation
- Solidified planning strategies and clear goals for each quarter

Cons:

- More process can mean more meetings and less time spent coding
- A larger team can mean less individual input/direction of a project
- Can be harder to adopt newer technologies due to legacy applications, etc

### Large corporations

> Typically 5,000+ employees, 10+ years old

Pros:

- Usually have the resources to pay higher salaries
- Traditionally more vetted process to get hired; therefore, lots of opportunity to learn from team members
- Stock options (you benefit when your company benefits)

Cons:

- Tend to feel like you are a small fish in a large pond (contributions are not as tangible)
- Career advancement (i.e. promotions, switching teams) can be a long-winded process
- Harder to bond as a team if globally distributed

All of these factors are good things to be mindful of when looking to switch companies or if you are looking to join your first company. A lot of resources have surfaced over the last 5-10 years that help folks get an "inside view" into a company's interview process, culture, and salaries. A few that are particularly useful are:

Helpful tools:

## Resume

I like to think that every one that is on the job hunt has a personal billboard that they carry around with them. You can write on it, or decorate it however you like. What you decide to put on your personal billboard will greatly affect your chances of getting an interview or not. Some things to keep in mind when writing a resume are as follows:

- Keep it short (1 page, 2 pages if you have 10+ years of experience)
- Tailor your resume to the job you want
- If past technology is not applicable, try to make it applicable or leave it out
- Write 3-5 bullet points for each job
- Make your contributions impactful by using metrics (Wrote a function that processed 10,000k data points, Cut down on processing time by 60%)

Keep in mind, a recruiter or HR representative will only spend 10-15 seconds scanning your resume, you do not have much time. You want to make sure you include details that will help illustrate that you can help this company. With that being said, a few things you might want to leave out are:

- A personal photo
  - _Instead_: Make your name and the position you _want_ catch the eye
- Graph representations of skill level
  - _Instead_: Try replacing with a list of technologies sorted, starting with the highest comfort level
  - _Or_: List your skills in alphabetical order and make skills you are best at _bold_
- Listing jobs that are not relevant to the career field
  - _Instead_: Use that space to expand on the experience you have in the software industry, if you don't have much experience yet, this is a great place to expand on a project(s) you have worked on

### Try it out

Another great way to determine if your resume is conveying what you would like it to is to have a friend read it for 15 seconds. After time is up, take the resume and have them tell you what they remembered from the resume. This can be a company name, skill, or contact information. This is a great trial run to determine what grabs a person's eye when they scan your resume.

## Set a schedule

> By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail

Let's just face it, the job hunt is an exhausting and grueling affair for most. I have found that the best way to approach the job search is to have two important things before you start:

- Goals (daily, weekly, and overall)
- Plan of action (daily and weekly)

### Goals

I know what you are thinking, _ummm, my goal is to get a new job?_ Of course this is the end goal; however, in my experience, spending the time to determine what your goals are early is a great way to feel productive and confident. The reason I broke down these goals into two categories is that it is important to feel like you are being productive every day, even if you are not getting emails or calls back.

Some examples I have used in the past for daily and weekly goals are:

##### Daily

- Submit 10 applications
- Spend 30 minutes on a side project

##### Weekly

- Schedule a phone interview
- Spend 2 hours on technical interview prep

These might seem overly simplified and, you're right! That is the idea. You want to make sure you make your daily and weekly goals something that is easily measurable, and _sustainable_.

## Make the most of your time

So far we have talked about the importance of determining your ideal role, refining your resume, and setting a schedule for yourself. To ensure that these tasks are not wasted effort, you want to make sure you are making the most of your time.

What I mean by that can be thought of as the old saying _Set yourself up for success_ or _Put the right foot forward_. Basically, you want to make sure you are equally balanced in your journey to getting more interviews and being successful at them.

Besides doing the items mentioned above, a few others that can carry great importance are:

- Practice
- Side projects
- Online presence

### Practice

Out of all the things I mention in this post, this one should come as the least of a surprise.

To get better at coding, problem-solving, interviewing, or underwater basket weaving you have to _practice_, A LOT. There is no getting around this step. I, like many, have fell victim to a cycle of planning too much, taking too many tutorials, or telling ourselves _I'll start tomorrow_.

For me, this was, and still is the hardest part about preparing for interviews, or quite honestly just being in this industry in general. Things move really quickly, and no one wants to feel like they are falling behind. But, tech is a mentally draining profession. It is more than understandable that the thought of practicing coding interview questions in any capacity is exhausting. I have some good news though.

When you think about practicing, try to think of your current skills as water in a bucket. Each time you practice, even something you think is small or not enough, think of that as drops of water that fill your bucket. All experiences, good or bad, frustrating or rewarding fill this bucket up and make _you_ a stronger developer _every day_.

I think a great way to get into the habit of practicing writing code is to give yourself a goal per week. Remember, the ultimate goal is to practice and stay consistent, so avoid setting the bar at an unrealistic level for yourself. All this will do is make you feel bad on days you just don't feel like coding.

_YOU_ are the only person like _YOU_. There will never be anyone else like you, and that is awesome. So be nice to yourself, this stuff is hard. If you make a habit to practice just a little bit, each time that bucket will fill up and you will surprise yourself after just a few weeks of staying consistent. You got this!

### Side projects

This is something else that I am sure you have heard a million times, but I do think these can really help you not stand out as a candidate, but help you stay engaged on days you don't feel like practicing your coding skills.

In my experience, it has been easier to get started when you can think of answers to both of these two questions:

- What tech do I want to learn or get better at?
- What is a product I really like, or I wish existed?

With the answer to these two questions, you have a framework for your project! Do you like the new look of Twitter? Pick a feature and try to recreate the look and feel of it! Can't find a habit tracker app you like? Try building one yourself!

If you would prefer to contribute to a project that is already established, that's great as well! This can be a daunting task if it is your first time; however, there is a great website that lists tons of projects on Github that are looking for first time contributors.

### Online presence

I like to think of the web as another place that allows us to have our own "personal billboard". There are many advantages to having a solid presence online, some of them include:

- Networking/meeting other developers
- Showing off projects
- Potential interest from other companies

Putting in the extra effort to make your online presence solid can take you a long way, and the ways you can achieve this are relatively straight forward. Here are a few things I suggest you do:

- Build a portfolio site: This does not have to be an extravagant, complicated website if you do not want it to be. As long as it has contact information, links to your various profiles, and a blurb about yourself you should be good-to-go. This can be a great place to showcase your technical skills or talk about your passions and work history too
- Personalized URLs: A lot of common websites developers use (Github, LinkedIn, Medium, Dev.to, Twitter, etc) allow you to change your URL, I suggest you make it your user name. I would also suggest to try and use the same name for each website
- Start a blog: if you are not interested in building projects and would prefer writing, this is a great way to show your skills and build an audience
- Consistent profile photo: Ideally you want to use a photo that is both professional, but lets your personality shine through as well. Once you find one, try to use that same photo across your websites as well.
- Social Media: This is certainly not a requirement; however, if you want to leverage social media as a platform for your development, I suggest you tweet about things you learn and try to engage your audience often. Finding the balance of letting your personality show while also adding value via sharing your knowledge can be tricky, but your followers will love it!

## In Summary

Whether you are new to the field and looking for your first job, or if you are an experienced developer looking for a new challenge, I hope my insight can help. The job hunt can be a daunting, exhausting process but remember, it is a marathon, not a race. You got this. Consistency is key. Every rejection is an opportunity to improve your skills for the job you were meant for.
