This is the first post in my series _Interview Insights_. This week, I will share my thoughts and steps an individual should take to increase their chances of getting an interview as a software developer. Whether you are starting out, or looking for something new, I am confident that you will find value in what I share below. Let's get started!

## Determine your ideal role

This might sound strange, but I think it is a question that is overlooked.

Due to the eclectic nature of our industry, it is common to just apply to _any_ kind of job. This is tricky because on one hand, you want interviews and experience with different technologies; however, I have found that answering the questions can put you ahead in your search:

> _What kind of developer do I want to be?_

If you are looking for your first job, this might be the hardest question you have to answer. Although this might seem overly simplified, I do think it is most important to pick a niche of software that make _you happy_. After all, you are the one that will be doing this work 40 hours a week, right?

If you are brand new to software development and are not sure what you like best, I suggest browsing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and take a course that sounds interesting to you!

It is easy to get caught in a state of limbo when you are not sure what to do next. My advice is when that happens is to just pick something and try it.

> _What kind of company do I want to work for?_

This might be another tricky question to answer; however, it can really save you lots os headache down the road. In software development, there are typically three _types_ of companies:

### Startups

> Typically under 500 employees, less than 5 years old, fast-paced environment

Pros:

- You will play a large role in the problems that your company is trying to solve
- Working with cutting edge technology in the industry
- Lots of opportunity to learn from senior developers

Cons:

- Responsible for ("own") more pieces of the code base
- Processes such as code review and a team code style might not be established
- Quickly throwing out code you contributed to due to trying other ideas

### Mid-sized companies

> Typically 500-5,000 employees, 5+ years old

Pros:

- High chance of the company being profitable (job security)
- More onboarding resources and documentation
- Solidified planning strategies and clear goals for each quarter

Cons:

- More process can mean more meetings and less time spent coding
- A larger team can mean less individual input / direction of a project
- Can be harder to adopt newer technologies due to legacy applications, etc

### Large corporations

> Typically 5,000+ employees, 10+ years old

Pros:

- Usually have the resources to pay higher salaries
- Traditionally more vetted process to get hired; therefore, lots of opportunity to learn from team members
- Stock options (you benefit when your company benefits)

Cons:

- Tend to feel like you are a small fish in a large pond (contributions are not as tangible)
- Career advancement (i.e. promotions, switching teams) can be a long-winded process
- Harder to bond as a team if globally distributed

All of these factors are good things to be mindful of when looking to switch companies or if you are looking to join your first company. A lot of resources have surfaced over the last 5-10 years that help folks get an "inside view" into a company's interview process, culture, and salaries. A few that are particularly useful are:

## Resume

I like to think that everyone that is on the job hunt has a personal billboard that they carry around with them. You can write on it, or decorate it however you like. What you decide to put on your personal billboard will greatly affect your chances of getting an interview or not. Some things to keep in mind when writing a resume are as follows:

- Keep it short (1 page, 2 pages if you have 10+ years of experience)
- Cater your resume to the job you want
- If past technology is not applicable, try to make it applicable or leave it out
- Write 3-5 bullet points for each job
- Make your contributions impactful by using metrics (Wrote a function that processed 10,000k data points, Cut down on processing time by 60%)
