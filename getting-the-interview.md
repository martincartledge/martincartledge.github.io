This is the first post in my series _Interview Insights_. This week, I will share my thoughts and steps an individual should take to increase their chances of getting an interview as a software developer. Whether you are starting out, or looking for something new, I am confident that you will find value in what I share below. Let's get started!

## Determine your ideal role

This might sound strange, but I think it is a question that is overlooked.

Due to the eclectic nature of our industry, it is common to just apply to _any_ kind of job. This is tricky because on one hand, you want interviews and experience with different technologies; however, I have found that answering the questions can put you ahead in your search:

> _What kind of developer do I want to be?_

If you are looking for your first job, this might be the hardest question you have to answer. Although this might seem overly simplified, I do think it is most important to pick a niche of software that make _you happy_. After all, you are the one that will be doing this work 40 hours a week, right?

If you are brand new to software development and are not sure what you like best, I suggest browsing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and take a course that sounds interesting to you!

It is easy to get caught in a state of limbo when you are not sure what to do next. My advice is when that happens is to just pick something and try it.

> _What kind of company do I want to work for?_

This might be another tricky question to answer; however, it can really save you lots os headache down the road. In software development, there are typically three _types_ of companies:

### Startups

> Typically under 500 employees, less than 5 years old, fast-paced environment

Pros:

- You will play a large role in the problems that your company is trying to solve
- Working with cutting edge technology in the industry
- Lots of opportunity to learn from senior developers

Cons:

- Responsible for ("own") more pieces of the code base
- Processes such as code review and a team code style might not be established
- Quickly throwing out code you contributed to due to trying other ideas

### Mid-sized companies

> Typically 500-5,000 employees, 5+ years old, profitable, more stable

Pros:
