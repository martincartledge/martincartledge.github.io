### Fractions

#### Improper fractions and mixed numbers

##### Improper fraction to mixed number

- Write a division problem with the numerator divided by the denominator
- Divide to determine quotient and remainder
- Write mixed number with the quotient as the whole number and the remainder as the numerator over the same denominator

```
9/5 to mixed number

divide 9 by 5

5 goes into 9 one time and has a remainder of 4

The quotient is 1, the remainder is 4 (numerator), and the denominator is 5 still
```

##### Mixed numbers into improper fractions

- Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction
- Add the number of the numerator
- The result above is the new numerator
- The denominator is the same as the original fraction
- Simplify if possible by dividing the numerator and denominator by common factors

```
1 4/5 to improper fraction

multiply the whole number by the denominator 1 x 5

add that to the numerator of the fraction 5 + 4 = 9

the result is 9/5, no reduction is possible
```

#### Equivalent fractions

> Fractions that are the same value, e.g. 1/2 and 2/4

```
Transform 2/5 into a fraction with a denominator of 15

2/5 = ?/15

The denominator 15 is 3 times larger than 5

That means that the numerator must also be 3 times larger

That results in a new numerator value of 6

The equivalent fractions are 2/5 and 6/15
```

- Divide target fraction by the given fraction denominator
- Multiply that fraction result value by the value of the given numerator
- The result of the multiplied values is your new numerator value

```
How many 6ths are equivalent to 1/2?

2 goes into 6 3 times

The numerator value of 1 multiplied by 3 results in a fraction value of 3/6
```

#### Reducing fractions

Two ways to reduce fractions: prime factorization and factors


##### Prime factorization

- List the prime factors of both numerator and denominator
- Cancel the factors that are common of both the numerator and the denominator
- Multiply across the numerator and the denominator
